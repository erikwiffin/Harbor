# Harbor Positioning (2026)

**Status:** Internal reference — drives website copy, talks, and external materials.
**Last updated:** May 2026.

This document captures the current landscape, why Harbor still matters in it, and the language we use to describe the difference. Read it before you write a deck, a blog post, or a landing page about Harbor.

**Where this lives in the wider repo:**

- The **public site** (`whitepaper/index.html`, `landscape.html`, `spec.html`, `build.html`) is the rendered version of the framing on this page. If you change framing here, propagate it there.
- The **README** (`README.md`) and **spec README** (`spec/README.md`) carry the short version of the same argument.
- The **changelog** records when framing meaningfully changes; bump it when the differentiation argument or the comparison table moves.

If you're reaching for the literal copy that ships on the site, read `whitepaper/index.html` directly — it's hand-written HTML, not generated, so the words on the page are the words in the file.

## The one-line summary

> Harbor is the missing layer that lets *any* website use *the user's chosen AI* on *any browser*, with the user staying in control. Today's "AI browsers" make you pick a vendor. WebMCP gives pages a way to declare tools but not a way to get a model. Chrome's Prompt API gives you one model on one browser. Harbor is what happens when you treat AI as a browser capability — like `fetch()` is for networking — instead of a vendor product.

---

## Where the world is, May 2026

The browser–AI landscape has crystallized into four camps. Harbor is none of them.

### Camp 1 — AI-native browsers (the agent IS the browser)

| Browser | Vendor | Model | Posture |
|---|---|---|---|
| ChatGPT Atlas | OpenAI | GPT‑5 | Most agentic. Agent Mode clicks, fills, books, and shops in a sandboxed Chromium. macOS GA. |
| Comet | Perplexity | Perplexity + partners | Highly agentic personal-assistant browser. Long-running multi-tab automation, email/calendar connectors, e-commerce. |
| Dia | The Browser Company (Atlassian) | Multi-provider | "Chat with your tabs." Skills system. Local-first, intentionally less autonomous. |
| Copilot Mode in Edge | Microsoft | Microsoft Copilot | Cross-tab reasoning + scoped Actions. Conservative; enterprise-friendly. |
| Gemini in Chrome / Auto Browse | Google | Gemini | Rolled out January 2026. Origin-set sandboxing, User Alignment Critic, sensitive-action confirmations. |

**Pattern:** the browser company chooses the model. Your context, your task history, and (for Atlas/Comet) often your page content flow to one vendor. Switching means starting over. The agent reads the live web — which is exactly the surface where indirect prompt injection bites (Comet → 1Password vault, Atlas → omnibox injection, Comet → CometJacking, etc.).

### Camp 2 — Browser AI assistants (sidebar chat, BYO model)

- **Brave Leo (BYOM)** — Stable since 2024. Lets users connect Ollama or remote endpoints. Chat-only; doesn't expose anything to web pages.
- **Mozilla AI Window / AI Controls** — Announced Nov 2025; AI Controls shipped in Firefox 148 (Feb 2026). Multi-provider chat in the sidebar (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, Mistral). Opt-in. Doesn't expose anything to web pages.

**Pattern:** the user gets choice over their AI assistant, but websites can't program against it. AI is a feature *for the user*, not a *capability of the platform*. Pages still have to ship their own AI infra if they want their app to use AI.

### Camp 3 — The standards converging

- **WebMCP** — W3C Community Group draft, April 2026. `navigator.modelContext.addTool()` lets pages declare JavaScript-backed tools an agent can call. **Solves the page-side half** of the problem.
- **Chrome Prompt API** — `window.LanguageModel`, stable in Chrome 138 extensions, in origin trial for web pages. Gives pages on-device Gemini Nano. **One model, one browser**.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — Open protocol from Anthropic, now ubiquitous on the backend. Defines how agents talk to tool servers.

**Pattern:** each standard solves *part* of the problem. None of them, individually or together, answers the central question: *how does an arbitrary website call the user's chosen AI, with the user's chosen tools, on whatever browser the user happens to be on, without anyone holding their context hostage?*

### Camp 4 — BYOK in IDEs and dev tools

- **VS Code Language Model Chat Provider** (Oct 2025), **JetBrains BYOK** (Dec 2025), **Vercel AI Gateway BYOK**, **GitHub Copilot SDK BYOK**, **Byoky** (browser-extension key wallet).

**Pattern:** the same idea — let users bring their keys — has won inside developer tools. It hasn't crossed over to the open web. Harbor is the open-web version of this idea.

## What's missing

No one is shipping the combination of:

1. **A portable contract** between websites and the user's chosen AI that works across browsers (not just Chrome's Prompt API; not just Firefox AI Window).
2. **A unified permission boundary** that covers LLMs + remote MCP servers + page tools as a coherent whole, scoped per-origin, like `geolocation` or `camera`.
3. **AI as a web platform capability** — a website calls `window.ai.createTextSession()` the same way it calls `fetch()`, without caring which model, key, or browser the user has, and without the website ever touching the credentials.
4. **An architectural answer to the prompt-injection problem**: instead of an agent free-roaming the DOM (Comet, Atlas), websites *delegate* via a scoped API. The user's AI mediates. Permissions throttle each side.
5. **Today's adoption path**: ship now, on Firefox and Chrome, as an extension, while the standards mature. A polyfill, not a vendor.

That combination is Harbor's lane.

## How we say the differentiation

Three sentences, in order of importance:

1. **"Today's agentic browsers ask you to pick a vendor; Harbor lets you bring your AI to every website you already use."**
2. **"WebMCP standardizes how pages expose tools. Chrome's Prompt API standardizes one model. Harbor is the missing piece: a browser-mediated contract where any website can use the user's chosen AI, with the user's chosen tools, scoped per origin."**
3. **"It's not a browser. It's a proposal — with a working implementation — for treating AI like `fetch()`: a capability the platform provides, not a product the user has to buy into."**

If we have one minute, we say all three. If we have ten seconds, we say the first.

## Differentiation table

This is the table that goes on the website and in decks. Numbers/labels are May 2026.

| | Vendor agent browsers (Atlas, Comet, Gemini in Chrome) | Sidebar AI assistants (Brave Leo, Firefox AI Window) | Chrome Prompt API + WebMCP alone | **Harbor + Web Agent API** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Who picks the model | The browser vendor | The user (chat-only) | Chrome (Gemini Nano) | **The user** |
| Who pays for inference | Mixed (vendor often subsidizes) | The user | Free, on-device | **The user — including local & free** |
| Can a website use the AI? | Through the vendor's product, on the vendor's terms | No | Yes, but only on Chrome with Gemini Nano | **Yes, on Firefox and Chrome, with any model the user has configured** |
| Cross-origin tool calls (MCP) | Vendor-curated | None | Not in scope | **Yes — any MCP server the user trusts** |
| Page-declared tools (WebMCP) | Sometimes, vendor-mediated | No | Yes | **Yes — implements `navigator.modelContext` today** |
| Permission boundary | Browser-wide / app-wide | Sidebar opt-in | Per-API, on Chrome | **Per-origin, per-scope, revocable** |
| Prompt-injection surface | Large: agent reads the live DOM autonomously | Small: chat is user-driven | Small: no agent | **Small: websites delegate via scoped APIs; the agent is not free-roaming** |
| Where context lives | With the vendor | With the assistant chat (sometimes synced) | On-device (Gemini Nano cache) | **In the browser, mediated to sites with consent** |
| Works in Firefox? | No | Yes for Mozilla's; partially for others | No | **Yes — primary target** |

## What we are not

- **Not a browser.** We don't compete with Firefox, Chrome, Edge, Atlas, Comet, Dia. We run *inside* them.
- **Not an agent.** Harbor does not autonomously browse. It exposes a contract; the page or the user drives.
- **Not a model provider.** We connect to the models you bring (Ollama, llamafile, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, …).
- **Not a Mozilla product.** It's a sketch from people inside Mozilla, but the goal is a standard the whole web can adopt — not a Firefox-only feature.
- **Not a finished design.** It's version 0.1, deliberately. We want feedback before we calcify.

## Where Harbor sits relative to the standards

| Layer | Standard | Harbor's stance |
|---|---|---|
| Page declares tools | **WebMCP** (`navigator.modelContext`) — W3C CG, April 2026 | We implement it today; we'd happily yield this surface to the spec. |
| Page calls a model | **Chrome Prompt API** (`window.LanguageModel`) — Chrome 138+ | We implement a compatible `window.ai`; same code runs on either. |
| Cross-origin tools | **MCP** | We host MCP servers (WASM/JS in-browser; native via the Rust bridge); developers pick any servers they want. |
| Browser-mediated agent + permissions | **No standard yet** | This is the gap. Our `window.agent` proposal is what we'd put on the standards track. |

## The two-paragraph elevator

> Every website that wants AI features has three bad options today: ask users for API keys, run their own AI backend, or embed someone else's. The new "AI browsers" — Atlas, Comet, Dia, Copilot Mode, Gemini in Chrome — try to solve this from the wrong end: they replace your browser with their agent and route your context to one vendor. Standards like WebMCP and Chrome's Prompt API are real progress, but each solves only a slice.
>
> Harbor proposes a fourth option: AI as a browser capability. The browser holds your model connections, your credentials, and your tools. Websites declare what they need through `window.ai` and `window.agent`. Pages can expose their own functions through WebMCP. Permissions are per-origin and revocable. You bring your AI to the web; the web doesn't drag you into someone else's AI. We've shipped a working implementation — two extensions and a Rust bridge — on Firefox and Chrome to prove it's viable. It's a starting point for a conversation, not a product.

## Talking points by audience

### For developers building web apps

- You write `await window.ai.createTextSession()` and the user's model handles it. No keys, no backend, no per-user billing.
- You pick which MCP servers your app integrates. The user approves them. You don't ship credentials.
- One code path works against Chrome's Prompt API (when Gemini Nano is available) and against Harbor (when the user has a different model).
- You expose your domain logic via `navigator.modelContext.addTool()` (the W3C WebMCP API). Any agent — Harbor today, Chrome's tomorrow, Atlas's eventually — can call it.

### For people thinking about security and privacy

- The agent doesn't free-roam the DOM. Websites delegate via a scoped API, which keeps the prompt-injection surface roughly the size of a normal Web API surface — not the size of "the entire web."
- Permissions are per-origin (`example.com` can't act on `other.com`'s credentials), per-scope (`model:prompt` ≠ `mcp:tools.call`), and revocable.
- Local-first is real: Ollama and llamafile mean the data never leaves the machine. Cloud is a choice, not a default.
- Compare to Comet: a calendar invite was enough to exfiltrate a 1Password vault, because the agent had cross-service access and trusted what it read on a page. Our threat model assumes the agent will be tricked, and the architecture limits the blast radius.

### For browser vendors and standards people

- We're not asking Firefox or Chrome to ship Harbor. We're saying: here is a working implementation of what AI as a browser capability could look like, so the standards conversation has something concrete to argue about.
- WebMCP covers one half. Chrome's Prompt API covers another sliver. Harbor is the proposal for the rest, designed to be implementable by browsers natively and forward-compatible with both existing standards.
- Concrete artifacts: the explainer, the security/privacy doc, the WebIDL. Take them, fork them, push back on them.

### For Mozilla / open-source / "user-controlled AI" people

- The "AI Window" approach gives the user choice in the chat sidebar. That's important and good. Harbor extends the same principle to *every website's interaction with AI*, not just the chat.
- The architecture matches Mozilla's stated direction (user choice, openness, not locked in) but answers a question Mozilla hasn't yet: how does the *page* get a model?
- Harbor is not a Mozilla product. It's a way to test whether the architecture works, on Firefox and Chrome, before any browser commits to anything.

## Headlines and taglines we like

- **"AI as a browser capability."**
- **"Bring your AI to every site."**
- **"Your model. Your credentials. Your context. Every website."**
- **"The web doesn't have to pick an AI vendor."**
- **"AI on your side."** (carried over from the existing whitepaper)

## Headlines we avoid

- "Harbor is an AI browser." (We're not a browser.)
- "Harbor is a Mozilla product." (It isn't.)
- "Replace ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini with Harbor." (We're not a model.)
- "Harbor is secure because it has fewer features." (We have a positive security story; lead with it.)
