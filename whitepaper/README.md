# Harbor public site (`whitepaper/`)

This directory is the source for the Harbor public site, served via GitHub Pages.

It is a **static HTML site** as of May 2026 — the previous Jekyll setup was retired
when the site was redesigned. `.nojekyll` is present so GitHub Pages serves the
files exactly as they sit here.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `index.html` | Home page — hero, problem, proposal, three primitives, comparison table, standards convergence, architecture, examples, security, invitation, get-started. |
| `landscape.html` | Long-form essay: "the 2026 landscape, in four shapes." Linked from the home page and the nav. |
| `spec.html` | Web Agent API spec page — high-level overview, API surface, permission scopes, threat-model paragraph, with deep-link to the full explainer in the repo. |
| `build.html` | Quickstart for developers: install, hello-AI, run-an-agent, expose page tools, links to the deep developer docs. |
| `styles.css` | Shared design system — type tokens, color tokens, components. Light by default; `.dark` on `<html>` for dark mode. |
| `DESIGN_NOTES.md` | Type / color / spacing rationale and component decisions. Read this before iterating on the design. |
| `CLAUDE_DESIGN_PROMPT.md` | The brief that was fed into Claude Design to produce the redesign. Kept for reference. |
| `PROMPT_FOR_EXTERNAL_MOZILLA_INTELLIGENCE.md` | Older prompt artifact (predates the May 2026 redesign). Kept for history. |
| `whitepaper.pdf` | The original whitepaper PDF, still linked from the footer. |
| `design-bundle/` | Paper trail of the Claude Design handoff — the chat transcript and the bundle's README. |

## Editing

The site is hand-written HTML. Content changes happen directly in the `.html`
files. Style changes happen in `styles.css`.

The canonical source for **messaging** (positioning, talking points, the
differentiation argument) is **[`docs/POSITIONING.md`](../docs/POSITIONING.md)**.
If you change Harbor's framing on the site, change it there first so the website,
the spec, the README, and any decks stay in sync.

## Local preview

This is plain static HTML — open `index.html` directly in a browser, or run any
static server in this directory:

```bash
cd whitepaper
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

## Deploy

GitHub Pages serves `whitepaper/` (configured in repo settings → Pages). Push to
`main`; the live site updates within a minute or two.
